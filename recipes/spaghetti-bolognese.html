        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>28 ounces crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 good sized handful fresh parsley chopped</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>Grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese for serving optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté until lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and fry another minute.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef; fry until fully cooked and no pink shows at all in the meat (about 8 minutes). Add the oregano and tomato paste and mix with the meat.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes, parsley, and bring to a boil. Season with the salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to low, and cook for at least 15 minutes (you can cook longer for a deeper flavor).</li>
            <li>In the meantime, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. Drain and serve topped with the sauce and cheese (if using).</li>
        </ol>
